# Quantum Technology Leadership: US vs China Patent & Funding Analysis (2014-2024)

## Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive comparative analysis of quantum technology progress between the United States and China through patent filings and government funding over the past decade (2014-2024). The research examines who is leading in quantum computing, sensing, and communications through data-driven analysis of patent databases and funding reports.

## Key Findings

### Patent Leadership
- **China**: 37% of global quantum patents (2003-2022), leading in quantum communications (34%)
- **United States**: 28% of global quantum patents, leading in quantum computing hardware and research quality
- **Quantum Sensing**: Nearly tied (US: 23.7%, China: 23.3%)

### Funding Comparison
- **China Government Investment**: $15 billion (3x US investment)
- **US Government Investment**: $3.7-5 billion 
- **US Private Investment**: $3.3 billion (7x China's private investment)
- **China Private Investment**: $482 million

### Growth Trends
- Patent activity accelerated dramatically from 2017-2018
- 58% average annual growth in quantum patents worldwide
- China's patent applications grew 6x from 137 (2020) to 804 (2022)

## Data Sources

- **Patent Data**: PatentsView (USPTO), WIPO, EPO, JPO, CNIPA
- **Funding Data**: NSF, CSIS, OECD, McKinsey, China's R&D reports
- **Research Sources**: Academic papers, government reports, industry analysis

## Technology Areas Analyzed

1. **Quantum Computing**: Hardware development, software applications, error correction
2. **Quantum Communications**: Quantum key distribution, quantum internet, satellite communications
3. **Quantum Sensing**: Precision measurement, navigation, medical applications

## Methodology

This analysis uses patent filing trends as a proxy for innovation activity and technological progress, combined with government and private funding data to understand investment patterns and strategic priorities.

## Key Insights

- China has adopted a state-led approach with massive government investment
- The US relies more heavily on private sector innovation and funding
- Both countries show different strengths across quantum technology segments
- Competition has intensified significantly since 2017
